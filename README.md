## Prerequisites

- Java JDK 11 (or later)
- Maven (or Gradle, if preferred)  
- Git
- IntelliJ IDEA (or your favorite Java IDE)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/naiverahul/Graph_visualizer
   cd Graph_visualizer
   ```

2. **Build the application:**

   Using IntelliJ IDEA:
   - Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
   - Build the project using Maven or Gradle.
   - Run the application and open the following link in your browser:

1. **Using Maven Spring Boot plugin:**

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

2. **Using the packaged JAR:**

   ```bash
   java -jar target/Graph_visualizer.jar
   ```

3. **Access the application:**

   Open your browser and navigate to:

   ```
   http://localhost:9090
   ```

## Running the App with IntelliJ IDEA

1. **Import the project:**

   - Click on **File > Open...** and select the projectâ€™s root directory.
   - IntelliJ will detect the Maven (or Gradle) configuration and import the project.

2. **Locate the main class:**
   - In the Project Explorer, find the main application class (e.g., `GraphVisualizerApplication.java` in the package `com.example.graphvisualizer`).

3. **Run the application:**
   - Right-click the main class and select **Run 'GraphVisualizerApplication'**.
   - The application console will display startup logs indicating that the Spring Boot app is running.

4. **Access the application:**

   Open your browser and go to:

   ```
   http://localhost:9090
   ```
